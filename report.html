We can also see that the tail fibres, which are the detectors of cells, are electrically charged, thus making them ionic proteins. The tail fibres act exactly like the Coronavirus spike proteins: they bind to a specific compound on the surface of the bacteria, but they don't access it. They only bind to the surface, perforate it using the spikes and then, due to a difference in pressures, the genetic material is injected into the cell. Then, it uses the fact that bacteria will integrate strands of genetic material floating in the environment into its own hereditary material in order to force the host to reproduce the virus.</div><div class="clear"></div>

They allow us not only to move about, but to socialize and tend to others, to express ourselves using art, to take care of ourselves, and many more things that we think are a given and thus, pay no attention to. That's why, when parts  of them start to fail, humanity looked at its best friend, the brain, and asked it to develop a solution for this problem. And so it did: humans had created the artificial implant. A lot of people who weren't able to walk now could. However, a few months later, doctors realized that the zone around where they implanted the piece was warm to the touch and was starting to swell and redden: typical symptoms of an infection. So, they treated it with broad-spectrum antibiotics, in hopes that this simple treatment fixed the ailment while scientists applied Koch's Pustulates in order to find the cause.. And it did� that time. A few years later, after thousands of such infections, one patient stopped responding to antibiotics. And then another. And then a hundred more. The first antibiotic-resistant bacteria were born. So, after much studying, doctors, pharmaceutics, and biologists joined forces and developed a new compound to help fight it. And it helped until, again, there were some cases in which it didn't. So the doctors, with the help of biotechnologists, turned to a fairly old line of research that had been abandoned as soon as penicillin was discovered: the little bacteria-eating vira appropriately named <span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{bacteriophages}.\newline</div><div class="clear"></div>

This transport will always be in favour of the pressure gradient, which means that it cannot insert any kind of substance into an environment that has a higher pressure than the other side}, which regulates the transport of materials entering and exiting the cell. Integrated inside them are a type of integral protein\footnote{Integral protein: protein that is situated perpendicularly to the cell wall, allowing for communication between the exterior and interior} called penicillin-binding protein (PBP), amongst other  proteins such as protein channels. We will only talk about PBPs because they are the Achilles's Heel of bacteria, as long as one has the proper tools to exploit it. Whilst the name implies PBPs are only sensible to penicillin, the name actually came to be this way because it's how they were discovered, and in fact could be resistant to it but sensible to other similar antibiotic agents. Variations in this protein may lead in some cases to antibiotic resistance, such as MRSA (<span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Methicillin-Resistant <span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Staphylococcus aureus}}), a variation of Staph that is the result of a variation in this protein called PBP2A.

This treatment is incompatible with aminoglycosides, a type of antibiotic that inhibit protein synthesis, as it can lead to nephrotoxicity\footnote{Nephrotoxicity: damage to the kidneys} and ototoxicity\footnote{Ototoxicity: damage to hearing}. Vancomycin can induce platelet-reactive antibodies in the patient, leading to internal bleeding, with petechial haemorrhages on the tongue and bruises on most of the body. Unfortunately, even with use of vancomycin, <span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Staphylococcus aureus} can develop resistance. In this case, no other option than using a biological factor is left. There has been one study in 2020 that discovered that by modifying the bacteria with a cationic oligopeptide\footnote{Cationic oligopeptide: sequence of two or more amino acids that is positively charged}, vancomycin resistance could be bypassed. This could be a good solution temporarily as we wait for phage therapy to get improved on and approved, if it was a sufficiently studied option, which is not. This was discovered in 2020, while bacteriophage trials have been ongoing since the mid 2000s.</div><div class="clear"></div>

It comes from the <span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Caudovirales} order, which means that it is a bacteriophage with tail.  This treatment is still in testing, but it appears to be effective and lead to low adverse results. If possible, it would be preferable to use bacteriophage therapy (shortened to phage therapy) instead of going for antibiotics, as it can lead to less side effects than antibiotics, as it only attacks specific bacteria. This means, unfortunately, that the infection has to be pinpointed with extreme accuracy. The use of this treatment also negates the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. It is, however, unclear whether the bacteriophage could mutate into a dangerous strain. This class of vira has been studied since the late 19th century after being discovered by accident in water from a river in India. This research, however, was dropped due to penicillin being discovered and used, sometimes abusively, as the main purpose of this research was to use it on war casualties in order to reduce mortality caused by infections.</div><div class="clear"></div>

Source: Own results</span>}<span class="keyword2">\end{wrapfigure}</span>Bacteriophages work in an interesting manner. They work by detecting one very specific bacteria, just like any other virus does with the type of cell they evolved for, then bind to it and inject their genetic material, which then in turn the bacteria considers as its own, inserts it into its own genetic sequence and starts producing the proteins the virus requires, but it doesn't eject them. Once the bacteria is full of phages, a special lytic compound is released which bursts the cell membrane in such a way that it resembles an explosion, but instead of heating up everything in a radius, spreads millions more of bacteriophages, which then bind to other bacteria and the cycle repeats until there's no more bacteria left. The fight from the bacteria point of view consists mostly on trying to outnumber and outreproduce the phages in order to have a chance of survival, even if minimal. There is no known bacteria that shows resistance to phages. That is probably because, unlike the chemical factors, phages can evolve and improve with each generation.</div><div class="clear"></div>

Most of these results were not only confirmed by the highly-specific detection of the MSA plate, but also by taking the morphological observation into account, both of the colonies and microscopically.<span class="keyword2">\begin{figure}</span>[H]\centering<span class="keyword2">\begin{subfigure}</span>[b]{0.4\linewidth}<span class="keyword1">\includegraphics</span>[width=\linewidth]{microscope.JPG}<span class="highlight-sh" title="A caption should end with a period [sh:capperiod]"><span class="keyword1">\caption</span>{<span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Staphylococcus aureus} as seen below the microscope. x4000, GRAM tinction</span>}<span class="keyword2">\end{subfigure}</span><span class="keyword2">\begin{subfigure}</span>[b]{0.4\linewidth}<span class="keyword1">\includegraphics</span>[width=\linewidth]{colonies.JPG}<span class="keyword1">\caption</span>{Colonies of <span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Staphylococcus aureus} seen under a magnifying glass}<span class="keyword2">\end{subfigure}</span><span class="keyword1">\caption</span>{Photographies of the results, as collected from my own experimentation (own data).}<span class="keyword2">\end{figure}</span><span class="highlight-sh" title="A paragraph heading should not be written in all caps.

[sh:secskip]">paragraph</span>{}</span>There may be several reasons for the infection rate and thus natural prevalence to be increasing. One of them could be that since antibiotic abuse is growing with each passing year, the usual resident microbiota is getting killed, leaving more resources for Staph to thrive in that environment. To confirm this theory, we will look at the infection rates of a country that is facing extreme antibiotic abuse (the United States of America) and compare it to another that is controlling their antibiotics a bit better (the United Kingdom). The former have seen a 210\% increase in <span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Staphylococcus aureus} cases since 2006. However, superfluous antibiotic prescriptions have increased by barely 1\%\cite{baggsEstimatingNationalTrends2016}. In the United Kingdom, they have seen a 160\% increase in <span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Staphylococcus aureus} infection<span class="highlight-sh" title="Add a space before citation or reference. [sh:c:001]">s\cite</span>{englandMSSABacteraemiaAnnual2021}, and their superfluous antibiotic prescriptions have gone down by 20\%. Even though this is very little data to extract conclusions from, there may be a correlation between these two factors.</div><div class="clear"></div>

An increase of ambient temperatures could mean a more suitable breeding ground for this specific species and thus leading to a higher-than-usual prevalence. <span class="keyword1">\emph</span>{Staphylococcus aureus}' optimal breeding temperature is between 35\si{\celsius} and 37\si{\celsius}. The global average temperature has increased by 1,1\si{\celsius}\cite{gmsGMSAnnualGlobal2016} in the last 120 years.
