\section{Experimental conclusions}
This study has concluded that the prevalence of \emph{Staphylococcus Aureus} in our high school is 48,8\%, a 150\% of the percentage expected. As explored previously, this could mostly be due to climate change or antibiotic abuse.

\section{Strengths and weakneses}
This research was not without its strengths, but neither was it without its weakneses.
\paragraph{Strengths} The protocol was adapted fairly well to the environment it was run in, and no incidents took place during the realisation of the experimentation.
\paragraph{Weakneses} While the Agar plates used were definitely adequate for the purpose they were used for, a much more appropriate growth medium called Baird-Parker (BP) could've been used.
