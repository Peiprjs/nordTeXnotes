\section{Introduction}
This research project will study the effects of \emph{Staphylococcus aureus} on the human body, as well as the ways humanity has developed to defeat it. Experimentally, the goal is to find the prevalence amongst the students in the school and recreate virtually a virus used to defeat this bacteria. The bacteria that are going to be sampled will also be tinted and observed under an optical microscope.\newline
The investigation question is ``\emph{What is the prevalence of} Staphylococcus aureus\emph{in the high school?}``
