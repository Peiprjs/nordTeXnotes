\section{An overview of the study}

\section{Bacteria and bacterial infections}
\paragraph{Bacteria} are prokaryote organisms, generally single-celled, which are part of the Monera animal kingdom. Their sizes range from between \SI{30}{\micro\metre} and \SI{100}{\micro\metre} and are ubiquitous\footnote{Ubiquitous: found everywhere} organisms. This form of life is believed to be the first one to have ever appeared on Earth, as well as the one responsible for the oxigen-rich atmosphere the Earth currently has. Some species are hard to culture in a laboratory environment, but generally, those that can be cultured in a controlled environment are grown in agar plates\cite{MicrobioMed}. \newline
Agar is used as a place to grow bacteria due to the fact that it is indigestible for the majority of bacteria, yet it keeps them humid and, together with growth mediums, such as Lysogeny Broth, bacteria thrive in this environment, allowing them to proliferate and create colonies, which can be seen to the naked eye. Sometimes, together with the growth medium, additives such as mannitol salt are added. These are used to improve or impede bacterial growth, modify their conditions so they develop differently or as an identification tool. For example, \emph{Staphyloccus Aureus} ferments it, producing acid, which in turn decolorates the plate from red to yellow.
\paragraph{Pathogenic bacteria} are bacteria that have the ability to cause disease\footnote{''A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury.''\cite{dorlands:001}}. These are not the most common type of bacteria, as the majority of them are either harmless or benefitial to the human body through symbiosis, such as the bacteria that help with digestion in the stomach\footnote{citation needed}.

\section{The enemy: Staphylococcus aureus}
\paragraph{}\emph{Staphylococcus aureus} (also known as Staph) is a GRAM-positive bacteria, the most virulent and studied of its genus\footnote{citation needed, got to check the proper terminology}. Some of its distinctive characteristics include having a very thick glycopeptide wall, which allows it to withstand extreme temperatures and osmotic pressures, therefore rendering most classic methods of food conservation (such as cooking, smoking, freezing or salting\footnote{citation needed}) completely useless against said bacteria;  a protein A capsid, which binds to many eukaryote organism. It's an extremely resistant (and thus ubiquitous) bacteria. It can be found in human skin and mucotic surfaces (such as the mouth or the nose), as well as in certain foods such as ham (cooked or curated), eggs, raw and cooked dough, as well as in poultry.

Staphylococcus Aureus has three main parts to its virulence: its cell wall, its membrane-bound factors and its secreted factors. Staph's \textbf{cell wall} is made up of three parts, going from inside to the outside of the cell: a plasma membrane, a peptidoglycan layer and a slime (sometimes also called capsule) layer.\newline %source: https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Plasma-Membrane%
The plasma membrane consists of a lipid bilayer that is semipermeable\footnote{Semipermeable: it lets water and ions through, but not other molecules. This transport will always be in favour of the pressure gradient, which means that it cannot insert any kind of substance into an environment that has a higher pressure than the other side}, which regulates the transport of materials entering and exiting the cell. Integrated inside them are a type of integral protein called penicillin-binding protein (PBP), amongst other  proteins such as protein channels. We will only talk about PBPs because they are the Achilles's Heel of bacteria, as long as you know how to exploit it. Whilst the name implies PBPs are only sensible to penicillin, the name actually comes because that's how they were discovered, and in fact could be resistant to it but sensible to other antibiotic agents. Variations in this protein may lead in some cases to antibiotic resistance, such as MRSA (\emph{Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus}), a variation of Staph that is the result of a variation in this protein called PBP2A. The different variations of \emph{Staphylococcus Aureus} will be discussed in more detail in a following section. \newline
\emph{Staphylococcus aureus}, like all other members of the \emph{Staphylococcus} family, have very thick peptidoglycan layers. This grants them protection from extreme temperatures and high osmotic pressures, which means these bacteria can colonise cooked food and food that has been salted. The most notable example is ham, either cooked, smoked or cured.
