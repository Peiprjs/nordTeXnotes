\section{Purpose}

This template is designed for International Baccalaureate students who
are looking to write an extended essary or an internal assessment using \LaTeX.
It is based on the MAA monograph AMS/MAA textbook template,
\url{http://www.ams.org/arc/books/book-produce.html#maamono}.  Some 
modifications have been made to the original class files and can be found
\verb!maatext.cls! and \verb!maabook.cls! to better meet the requirements of 
the International Baccalaureate and these modifications are maintained at 
\url{https://github.com/mholson/mhoTexmf/tree/main/texmf}.  

The original tempalte was meant to be compiled using XeLaTeX; however, this 
template has been designed to compile with pdfLaTeX such that the 
\verb!cmbright! font style is used throughout. \cite{Eigen1971}

I cannot guarentee that this template meets the submission requirements for
any piece of written work.  It is the responsibility of the student to 
ensure their work meets the specifications set forth by the examination board 
or their teacher.\cite{Olson2021}
