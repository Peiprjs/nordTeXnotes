\section{Risk assessment and prevention}
\paragraph{}Staph is considered a Biosecurity Level (BSL) 2 pathogenic bacteria. This means that the it is associated with a human disease that can pose a moderate human health hazard. In a laboratory where BSL-2 pathogens are handled, regular lab rules should be followed (mechanical pipetting only, hand washing, prohibiting the consumption of food and drinks in the lab, proper PPE use...), as well as avoiding splashes or aerosols, biohazard warning signs present on all material used, as well as proper surface and material disinfection via the use of autoclave or alternative decontamination method.[source: book] The risks associated with this bacteria were assessed following the protocol designated by the World Health Organisation [cite], and proper security measures were followed at all times when handling biohazardous material. No incidents occurred during the research part of this project, and the protocol defined previous to the start was followed to a T.
