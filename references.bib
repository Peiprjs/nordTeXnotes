  abstract = {The rising threat of antibiotic resistance and other adverse consequences resulting from the misuse of antibiotics requires a better understanding of antibiotic use in hospitals in the United States.To use proprietary administrative data to estimate patterns of US inpatient antibiotic use in recent years.For this retrospective analysis, adult and pediatric in-patient antibiotic use data was obtained from the Truven Health MarketScan Hospital Drug Database (HDD) from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2012. Data from adult and pediatric patients admitted to 1 of approximately 300 participating acute care hospitals provided antibiotic use data for over 34 million discharges representing 166 million patient-days.We retrospectively estimated the days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient-days and the proportion of hospital discharges in which a patient received at least 1 dose of an antibiotic during the hospital stay. We calculated measures of antibiotic usage stratified by antibiotic class, year, and other patient and facility characteristics. We used data submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Healthcare Cost Report Information System to generate estimated weights to apply to the HDD data to create national estimates of antibiotic usage. A multivariate general estimating equation model to account for interhospital covariance was used to assess potential trends in antibiotic DOT over time.During the years 2006 to 2012, 300 to 383 hospitals per year contributed antibiotic data to the HDD. Across all years, 55.1\% of patients received at least 1 dose of antibiotics during their hospital visit. The overall national DOT was 755 per 1000 patient-days. Overall antibiotic use did not change significantly over time. The multivariable trend analysis of data from participating hospitals did not show a statistically significant change in overall use (total DOT increase, 5.6; 95\% CI, -18.9 to 30.1; P\,=\,.65). However, the mean change (95\% CI) for the following antibiotic classes increased significantly: third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, 10.3 (3.1-17.5); macrolides, 4.8 (2.0-7.6); glycopeptides, 22.4 (17.5-27.3); {$\beta$}-lactam/{$\beta$}-lactamase inhibitor combinations, 18.0 (13.3-22.6); carbapenems, 7.4 (4.6-10.2); and tetracyclines, 3.3 (2.0-4.7).Overall DOT of all antibiotics among hospitalized patients in US hospitals has not changed significantly in recent years. Use of some antibiotics, especially broad spectrum agents, however, has increased significantly. This trend is worrisome in light of the rising challenge of antibiotic resistance. Our findings can help inform national efforts to improve antibiotic use by suggesting key targets for improvement interventions.}

This pathogen can cause a wide variety of diseases, ranging from moderately severe skin infections to fatal pneumonia and sepsis. Treatment of S. aureus infections is complicated by antibiotic resistance and a working vaccine is not available. There has been ongoing and increasing interest in the extraordinarily high number of toxins and other virulence determinants that S. aureus produces and how they impact disease. In this review, we will give an overview of how S. aureus initiates and maintains infection and discuss the main determinants involved. A more in-depth understanding of the function and contribution of S. aureus virulence determinants to S. aureus infection will enable us to develop anti-virulence strategies to counteract the lack of an anti-S. aureus vaccine and the ever-increasing shortage of working antibiotics against this important pathogen.},

Use of lytic bacteriophages (phages) for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections is one approach that has gained significant traction in recent years. Fueled by reports of experimental phage therapy cases with very positive patient outcomes, several early-stage clinical trials of therapeutic phage products have been launched in the United States. Eventual licensure enabling widespread access to phages is the goal; however, new paths to regulatory approval and mass-market distribution, distinct from those of small-molecule antibiotics, must be forged first.

  abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of a wide range of severe clinical infections. The range of diseases reflects the diversity of virulence factors produced by this pathogen. To establish an infection in the host, S. aureus expresses an inclusive set of virulence factors such as toxins, enzymes, adhesins, and other surface proteins that allow the pathogen to survive under extreme conditions and are essential for the bacteria's ability to spread through tissues. Expression and secretion of this array of toxins and enzymes are tightly controlled by a number of regulatory systems. S. aureus is also notorious for its ability to resist the arsenal of currently available antibiotics and dissemination of various multidrug-resistant S. aureus clones limits therapeutic options for a S. aureus infection. Recently, the development of anti-virulence therapeutics that neutralize S. aureus toxins or block the pathways that regulate toxin production has shown potential in thwarting the bacteria's acquisition of antibiotic resistance. In this review, we provide insights into the regulation of S. aureus toxin production and potential anti-virulence strategies that target S. aureus toxins.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of disease, particularly in colonized persons. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection has become increasingly reported, population-based S. aureus and MRSA colonization estimates are lacking. METHODS: Nasal samples for S. aureus culture and sociodemographic data were obtained from 9622 persons {$>$} or = 1 year old as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2002. After screening for oxacillin susceptibility, MRSA and selected methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis clonal type, toxin genes (e.g., for Panton-Valentine leukocidin [PVL]), and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type I-IV genes. RESULTS: For 2001-2002, national S. aureus and MRSA colonization prevalence estimates were 32.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 30.7\%-34.1\%) and 0.8\% (95\% CI, 0.4\%-1.4\%), respectively, and population estimates were 89.4 million persons (95\% CI, 84.8-94.1 million persons) and 2.3 million persons (95\% CI, 1.2-3.8 million persons), respectively. S. aureus colonization prevalence was highest in participants 6-11 years old. MRSA colonization was associated with age {$>$} or = 60 years and being female but not with recent health-care exposure. In unweighted analyses, the SCCmec type IV gene was more frequent in isolates from participants of younger age and of non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity; the PVL gene was present in 9 (2.4\%) of 372 of isolates tested. CONCLUSIONS: Many persons in the United States are colonized with S. aureus; prevalence rates differ demographically. MRSA colonization prevalence, although low nationally in 2001-2002, may vary with demographic and organism characteristics.},

  abstract = {Consistent with WHO's results and accountability frameworks, this Working Paper provides information on the programmatic and financial implementation of the Programme Budget 2020\textendash 2021 in the South-East Asia Region based on the end-of-biennium assessment. The`WHO Results Report Programme Budget 2020\textendash 2021 \textendash{} For a safer, healthier and fairer world' was presented at the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly.The Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019\textendash 2023, marked a new strategic direction for WHO. Measurable impact in countries lies at the heart of this strategy. The tenure of the Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13) was extended to 2025 by the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly in May 2022 to intensify and strengthen the support to countries in recovering from the impact of the pandemic and accelerate progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.Programme Budget 2020\textendash 2021 is the first of the Programme Budgets implemented under the Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13) 2019\textendash 2023, which provided a new strategic direction for WHO. With the publishing of the Results Report for Programme Budget 2020\textendash 2021, progress towards the `Triple Billion' targets, outcomes and outputs has been presented to Member States based on the GPW13 Results Framework.The SDG-based Triple Billion targets for healthier populations, universal health coverage and health emergencies define how WHO would help countries attain these targets through leadership, global public health goods/technical products and country support.The overall goal is to continuously improve WHO's accountability for results. Thisgenerates trust on the part of those the Organization serves and those who support WHO, and creates a virtuous cycle reinforcing WHO's leadership function 'to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work'.Structured methodologies, both quantitative and qualitative, were used for measuring and analysing the achievements and challenges thereto, and these include country and impact case studies to exemplify how the Organization's work is driving health impacts at the country level, where it matters most. Although battling the COVID-19 pandemic took centrestage in 2021, the Organization's achievements in that year go beyond how WHO responded to the COVID 19 pandemic. The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic early in 2020 posed unprecedented health and economic challenges worldwide and placed new and urgent demands on the Organization. Nonetheless, the Organization was able to respond and maintain its focus on the effective implementation of programmatic activities with the help of partners and stakeholders.The achievements of the Secretariat against each of the Outputs are assessed through six dimensions using the Output Scorecard. The Scorecard is refined further with experiences gained from the mid-term review (MTR) of PB 2020-21 and feedback received from various consultations and focus group discussions.The WHO Results Report complements the Financial Report; both are integral parts of the transparent presentation of the Organization's work in 2020ؘ\textendash 2021. The Detailed Results Report is available online at https://www.who.int/about/accountability/results/who-results report-2020-2021. The `WHO Results Report Programme Budget 2020\textendash 2021 \textendash{} For a safer, healthier and fairer world' was presented to the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly and noted by it. On the financial front, the 2020\textendash 2021 biennium saw the highest levels of financing (US\$ 7916 million) and implementation (US\$ 6640 million) across the Organization. The total amount of distributed resources for the biennium for the South-East Asia Region wasUS\$ 515.1 million and implementation (expenditure) was US\$ 476.3 million, which amounts to 92\% of the distributed resources. The approved Programme Budget was fundedat 115\% and its implementation was 107\%.This report was presented to the Fifteenth Meeting of the Subcommittee on Policy and Programme Development and Management (SPPDM), for its review and recommendations.The SPPDM meeting reviewed the paper and made the following recommendations for consideration by the Seventy-fifth Session of the Regional Committee: Actions by Member States(1) Continue engaging in and facilitating collaborative approaches for successful implementation of programmes at the country level. (2) Build on the progress made and lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic to achieve national targets and contribute to global and regional targets, namely the Thirteenth General Programme of Work and the Sustainable Development Goals.Actions by WHO (1) Ensure continued focus on effective Programme Budget implementation, country priorities and results, in alignment with the Regional Flagship Priority Programmes and the Thirteenth General Programme of Work.(2) Continue to monitor technical and financial implementation and strategic resourceallocation according to priorities agreed with the Member States.This Working Paper, along with the SPPDM recommendations, is submitted to the Seventy-fifth Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia for its consideration.},

  abstract = {Being endowed with an ability of capturing and releasing oxygen, the ceria surface conventionally assumes the role of catalyzing redox reactions in chemistry. This catalytic effect also makes possible its cytotoxicity toward microorganisms at room temperature. To study this cytotoxicity, we synthesized the doped and undoped ceria particles of 8-9 nm in size using an inexpensive precipitation method and evaluated their disinfecting aptitudes with the turbidimetric and plate count methods. Among the samples being analyzed, the silver-doped ceria exhibits the highest sterilization ability, yet the undoped ceria is the most intriguing. The disinfection effect of undoped ceria is moderate in magnitude, demanding a physical contact between the ceria surface and bacteria cell wall, or the redox catalysis that can damage the cell wall and result in the cell killing. Evidently, this effect is short-range and depends strongly on dispersion of the nanoparticles. In contrast, the disinfection effects of silver-doped ceria reach out several millimeters since it releases silver ions to poison the surrounding microorganisms. Additionally, the aliovalent silver substitution creates more ceria defects. The synergetic combination, silver poisoning and heterogeneous redox catalysis, lifts and extends the disinfecting capability of silver-doped ceria to a superior level.}

The characteristics like biofilm forming, facultative intracellular survival, and growing resistance of S. aureus pose a great challenge to its use in therapy. Nanoparticles are considered as a promising way to overcome the infections' therapeutic problems caused by S. aureus. In this paper, the present progress and challenges of nanoparticles in the treatment of S. aureus infection are focused on stepwise. First, the survival and infection mechanism of S. aureus are analyzed. Second, the treatment challenges posed by S. aureus are provided, which is followed by the third step including the advantages of nanoparticles in improving the penetration and accumulation ability of their payload antibiotics into cell, inhibiting S. aureus biofilm formation, and enhancing the antibacterial activity against resistant isolates. Finally, the challenges and future perspective of nanoparticles for S. aureus infection therapy are introduced. This review will help the readers to realize that the nanosystems can effectively fight against the S. aureus infection by inhibiting biofilm formation, enhancing intracellular delivery, and improving activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and small colony variant phenotypes as well as aim to help researchers looking for more efficient nano-systems to combat the S. aureus infections.},
